      "Discover how to layer perfumes and candle scents together to create a signature atmosphere that feels uniquely yours.",
    content: `
      <p>Layering is no longer reserved only for perfume on skin. In a candle-led home, scent becomes a composition that moves from flame to fabric and, finally, to the body. When done well, every element – candle, room spray, and personal fragrance – works together to create a signature atmosphere that feels quietly intentional.</p>

      <h3>Start with the Candle</h3>
      <p>Think of your candle as the base of your olfactory wardrobe. It sets the mood of the room long before a guest notices what you are wearing. Choose a "grounding" profile – woods, resins, amber, or soft musk – that you won’t tire of. This becomes the anchor that everything else will orbit around.</p>

      <p>Light your candle 20–30 minutes before you begin getting ready. Allow the wax pool to form fully across the surface; this not only protects the candle from tunnelling, but also ensures the fragrance starts to bloom into the space.</p>

      <h3>Add a Second Layer: The Air</h3>
      <p>Once the candle is lit, introduce a complementary room mist or diffuser. If your candle is rich and woody, try a mist with linen, tea, or soft citrus to keep the air feeling lifted. If the candle is already bright and sparkling, balance it with something skin-like and creamy – think vanilla, tonka or cashmere woods.</p>

      <p>Always spray into the centre of the room and let the fragrance fall naturally. Avoid misting directly over the flame or onto textiles that sit too close to the candle vessel.</p>

      <h3>The Final Veil: On the Skin</h3>
      <p>Only once your space is set should you reach for perfume. Instead of competing with the candle, your personal fragrance should echo one or two key notes. A jasmine-forward perfume feels luminous in a room perfumed with white florals and soft woods. A smoky incense fragrance feels more intimate when paired with a resinous, amber candle.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Floral Candle + Musky Perfume:</strong> Romantic, cocooning and perfect for evenings in.</li>
        <li><strong>Citrus Candle + Woody Perfume:</strong> Clean and modern, ideal for daytime rituals or creative work.</li>
        <li><strong>Gourmand Candle + Sheer Skin Scent:</strong> Comforting without becoming heavy or overpowering.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Ritual, Not Rules</h3>
      <p>There is no single correct way to layer. What matters is intention: trimming the wick, choosing one candle to lead, and building everything else gently around it. Over time, your home will smell unmistakably like you – long after the last flame has been blown out.</p>

    excerpt:
      "Learn how we're pioneering sustainable practices in luxury candles and home fragrance without compromising quality.",
    content: `
      <p>At Aluna, we believe the softest light should also be the lightest on the planet. Every candle we pour is an opportunity to choose better – for your home, for the artisans we work with, and for the landscapes that inspire our scents.</p>

      <h3>Wax That Respects the Ritual</h3>
      <p>We use carefully selected wax blends that prioritise clean burn and responsible sourcing. Our goal is simple: a steady, quiet flame with minimal soot and no harsh smoke, so the only thing that lingers is the scent and the memory of the moment.</p>

      <p>By partnering with suppliers who commit to traceability and reduced environmental impact, we make sure every ingredient – from wax to wick – honours the spaces our candles live in.</p>

      <h3>Vessels Meant to Stay</h3>
      <p>We design each vessel as an object worth keeping long after the last burn. Heavy glass, thoughtful proportions, and neutral tones allow our jars to be refilled, repurposed as drinkware, or reused as styling accents on your shelf.</p>

      <p>Our packaging is intentionally minimal: FSC-certified paper, recyclable materials, and inks selected with lower environmental impact in mind. Luxury, for us, is not excess – it is consideration.</p>

      <h3>Responsible Production</h3>
      <p>From small-batch pouring to controlled production runs, we choose quality over volume. This means less waste, fewer discarded units, and more time spent refining the details that matter: an even wax pool, a wick that behaves, and a fragrance throw that feels present but never overwhelming.</p>

      <p>Sustainability is a continuous practice. As we grow, so does our responsibility. Every collection is an invitation to refine, reduce, and reimagine what conscious candlemaking can look like.</p>

    excerpt:
      "Explore our curated selection of warm, comforting candle and home scents perfect for the winter season.",
    content: `
      <p>Winter invites us to move slower. Windows close, blankets appear, and our homes become the centre of our days. Scent is one of the easiest ways to make the season feel generous rather than harsh – especially when it begins with candlelight.</p>

      <h3>Spiced Glow</h3>
      <p>Look for candles built around cinnamon, clove, cardamom, and nutmeg. These "warming" notes mimic the feeling of being wrapped in a favourite knit. Style them on low surfaces – coffee tables, consoles, or bedside trays – where the flicker feels intimate and close.</p>

      <p>For balance, avoid stacking too many gourmand profiles in a single space. Pair a rich spiced candle in the living room with something drier and woodier in the hallway or entry to keep the air feeling sophisticated.</p>

      <h3>Woods for Quiet Evenings</h3>
      <p>Sandalwood, cedarwood, and smoked amber create a sense of stillness that suits long winter nights. These notes are wonderful for reading corners and workspaces, where you want presence without distraction.</p>

      <p>Burn time matters more in winter – we recommend alternating between two or three candles across the week, allowing each one a full, even melt pool before extinguishing. This not only protects the wax, but gives each scent its own evening to shine.</p>

      <h3>Layering Through the Home</h3>
      <p>Instead of lighting every candle at once, think in zones. A soft vanilla and cashmere blend in the bedroom, something resinous and smoky in the living room, and a crisp herbal profile in the kitchen keeps the home feeling dimensional rather than overwhelming.</p>

      <p>Our perennial winter favourite, <em>Midnight Velvet</em>, was created to bridge these worlds: dark florals, velvety woods, and a quiet sweetness that feels like the last light before midnight.</p>

    title: "Behind the Scenes: Creating Midnight Velvet",
    excerpt:
      "Join us behind the scenes of our bestselling scent story, from candle concept to finished fragrance collection.",
    content: `
      <p>Midnight Velvet began not as a formula on a screen, but as a single memory: the way candlelight catches the edge of a velvet curtain, the way shadows gather in the corners of a room while a jasmine-scented breeze drifts in from an open window.</p>

      <h3>Sketching a Mood in Wax</h3>
      <p>Before there was fragrance oil, there were sketches. Our creative director mapped the idea as a series of contrasts – light and shadow, softness and structure, floral and smoke. The candle had to feel nocturnal without becoming heavy, romantic without sweetness.</p>

      <p>Dozens of trial pours followed. Each test was burned, notes were made on how the scent moved from cold throw to hot, and how it behaved in different corners of the studio. Some versions were too floral, others too dark. Midnight Velvet emerged somewhere in the middle: a dark rose wrapped in woods and amber, carried by a quiet vanilla.</p>

      <h3>The Ritual Behind the Name</h3>
      <p>We imagine Midnight Velvet burning in the last hour of the evening: lights low, a book half-read, perhaps a record playing in the background. The wick crackles softly, the room fills slowly rather than all at once, and everything feels gently blurred at the edges.</p>

      <p>Every detail – from wax blend to wick diameter – was tested again and again to make sure the candle behaved beautifully over its full life. We wanted the final burn to feel as luxurious as the first.</p>

      <h3>A Vessel You Keep</h3>
      <p>Just as important as the scent is the object that holds it. Midnight Velvet’s vessel was designed as a weighty, minimal piece you would happily keep on your shelf. Once the last traces of wax are gone, it becomes a tumbler, a pen cup, or a place to keep the small things that mark your own nightly rituals.</p>

      "Transform your living space into a candlelit sanctuary with our expert tips on home fragrance styling.",
    content: `
      <p>A candlelit home doesn’t have to feel staged or formal. The most compelling spaces are those where scent feels like part of the architecture: subtle in the background, stronger in the pockets where you pause to sit, read, or share a drink.</p>

      <h3>Draw the Floor Plan With Light</h3>
      <p>Begin by thinking in terms of zones rather than rooms. Where do you first exhale when you walk in? Where do you work, linger, and rest? Place candles at these emotional touchpoints: an entry console, the corner of a sofa, the edge of a bathtub, a bedside table.</p>

      <p>Use taller vessels or pairs of candles where you want more drama, and single, low candles where you prefer something discreet. The goal is not brightness, but atmosphere.</p>

      <h3>Build a Scent Story</h3>
      <p>Choose one signature profile to repeat through the home – for example, creamy woods and amber – then allow each room its own nuance. In the living room, that might mean something smoky and resinous; in the bedroom, a softer interpretation with additional musk or vanilla.</p>

      <p>Support your candles with diffusers or room sprays in complementary notes. Diffusers keep hallways, bathrooms, and entryways quietly scented between burns, while room mists can refresh the air before you light the first wick of the evening.</p>

      <h3>Everyday Rituals</h3>
      <p>Reserve a specific candle for recurring moments: morning journaling, Sunday cleaning, a midweek bath. Over time, your body will start to associate that scent with slowing down or recharging, turning simple routines into grounding rituals.</p>

      <p>Above all, remember that a well-scented home is one that feels lived in, not curated to perfection. Let your candles evolve with you – new notes for new seasons, and the occasional favourite you always return to.</p>

      <p>Gifting scent is like gifting a mood. A candle can turn an ordinary evening into a small ceremony, and the right profile can say "I see you" more clearly than any note inside the box.</p>

      <h3>For the Minimalist</h3>
      <p>Choose candles with clean lines and quieter notes: white tea, linen, soft woods. Our Aurora-inspired scents are designed to disappear into a space while still making everything feel more intentional – the olfactory equivalent of a crisp white shirt and bare walls.</p>

      <h3>For the Bold Spirit</h3>
      <p>Look for darker vessels and compositions built around smoke, leather, or spice. A candle in the Midnight Velvet family makes a room feel like a private members’ club – intimate, moody, and impossible to forget.</p>

      <h3>For the Homebody</h3>
      <p>Layered candle sets and diffusers are perfect for those who love staying in. Our Sanctuary-style trios allow them to choose a different mood for morning, afternoon, and night, all within the same visual language.</p>

      <h3>The Art of Unboxing</h3>
      <p>Texture matters. We wrap every gift order in tactile paper, considered typography, and ribbon chosen to be kept rather than discarded. The moment the box is opened, the ritual has already begun – long before the wick is ever lit.</p>

    excerpt:
      "Explore the connection between scent, memory, and ritual—and how candles can quietly hold your most intimate moments.",
    content: `
      <p>Most of us can name a candle that feels like a chapter of our lives. The first apartment. The winter we finally slowed down. The person we loved who always burned the same scent in their hallway. Long after the flame has gone, the memory of that fragrance remains.</p>

      <h3>Why Candles Feel Like Places</h3>
      <p>Smell is processed in the same regions of the brain that handle memory and emotion. When you repeatedly light the same candle in a specific context – Sunday mornings, late-night baths, phone calls with someone far away – your mind quietly knots those moments together.</p>

      <p>Over time, striking a match and catching the first hint of wax melting can feel like stepping back into a room you haven’t visited in years.</p>

      <h3>Designing Future Memories</h3>
      <p>You can harness this intentionally. Choose one candle for a milestone – moving into a new home, launching a project, marking a new year. Burn it only for that purpose. When the jar is empty, keep the vessel as an object, and perhaps a spare box tucked into a drawer. When you smell that scent again years later, it will carry the entire season back with it.</p>

      <h3>Comfort in Routine</h3>
      <p>There is also comfort in smaller, daily rituals. A soft lavender candle that is always lit while you read in bed can help teach the body that it is safe to rest. A brighter citrus-and-herb blend at your desk might become a shorthand for focus and clarity.</p>

      <p>In a world that often moves too quickly, candles offer us something rare: a way to bookmark time with intention. Each flame, each fragrance, is a quiet invitation to remember where you are – and how you’d like to feel in this particular moment.</p>
